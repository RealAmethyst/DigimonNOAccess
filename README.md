## Installation
For this mod to work correctly you will need to disable steam input for the game. To do this open steam, right click the game in your library, go to manage, properties, then click on the controller tab, and set steam input to disabled. Big picture can also not be used as it won't let you name stuff in-game. Here is a list of what you need to play:
- [Digimon World next order](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1530160/Digimon_World_Next_Order/)
- [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/download/v0.7.1/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)
- the mod, which you can find over at the releases page, make sure to always use latest
First install the game from steam, then install melon loader and point it to the game, after that drop the mod you downloaded from here into the root folder of your game. Make sure steam input and big picture is off before playing.
